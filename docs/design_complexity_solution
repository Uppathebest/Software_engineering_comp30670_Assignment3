The design of my algorithm followed the following steps:

1) Read file from the Internet
2) Extract the right information (square size and instructions) from each line of the file
3) Create a square using the square size found in the first line of the file
4) Count number of lights turned on in the square
5) Following the instructions in each line, loop through the square and switch on/off the lights accordingly
	and output the result at the end (how many lights are on) 


For each of these steps I have created a function. 
1) read_uri(file)
2) extract(line)
3) LED_TESTER(value)
4) lights_number(square)
5) turn_switch(file)




The complexity of my solution lies in the number of sanity checks I had to perform in each function 
	to ensure that I would get the right result (despite wrong instructions or misleading instructions)

1) No sanity check needed
2) Stripped instructions of trailing whitespaces, checked 
	that 4 integer coordinates were supplied
3) Checked that size of square is correct
4) No sanity check needed
5) Check that coordinates are correct compared to square and compared to each other
